    <h1 id="main-title">costa rican gallo pinto</h1>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gallo Pinto</b></i> is a traditional Cental American dish and
      has a long history in both Nicaraguan and Costa Rican culture. In
      Costa Rica, this breakfast dish is usually served with a fried egg,
      fresh plantains, <em>homemade</em> tortillas, and a cup of Costa
      Rican coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rice and black beans are staples in the Costa Rican diet, and Gallo
      Pinto is typically made using the rice and beans that are leftover
      from the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallo Pinto translates to <q>spotted rooster</q>. The name is said
      to come from the speckeled appearance of the dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you beleive me if I told you that Gallo Pinto is considered one of
      the healthiest breakfast meals in the world? It's true! Accoring to Mike
      Dunphy's list of <cite><a href="https://time.com/4254125/healthy-international-breakfast/" target="_blank">10 Healthy International Breakfasts</a></cite>:
      <blockquote>
        Black beans—and the heavy amounts of iron, zinc, potassium, thiamin,
        and folate inside—play a central role in breakfast here. Mixed with
        rice, spiced with cumin, pepper, and garlic, Gallo Pinto often comes
        with eggs on the side and a host of vitamin-rich tropical fruits like
        mango, pineapple, papaya, and plantains. The breakfast might have a lot
        to do with Costa Rica's "Blue Zone" designation, given to countries with
        long-living populations.
        </blockquote>
      You can feel good about making this for your friends and family, knowing that it is, not only delicious, but also nutricious!
