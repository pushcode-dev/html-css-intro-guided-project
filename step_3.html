    <p>
      Gallo Pinto is a traditional Cental American dish and has a long history
      in both Nicaraguan and Costa Rican culture. In Costa Rica, this breakfast
      dish is usually served with a fried egg, fresh plantains, homemade
      tortillas, and a cup of Costa Rican coffee.

      Rice and black beans are staples in the Costa Rican diet, and Gallo Pinto
      is typically made using the rice and beans that are leftover from the day
      before.

      Gallo Pinto translates to spotted rooster. The name is said to come from
      the speckeled appearance of the dish.

      Would you beleive me if I told you that Gallo Pinto is considered one of
      the healthiest breakfast meals in the world? It's true! Accoring to Mike
      Dunphy's list of 10 Healthy International Breakfasts: >Black beans—and the
      heavy amounts of iron, zinc, potassium, thiamin, and folate inside—play a
      central role in breakfast here. Mixed with rice, spiced with cumin,
      pepper, and garlic, Gallo Pinto often comes with eggs on the side and a
      host of vitamin-rich tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, papaya, and
      plantains. The breakfast might have a lot to do with Costa Rica's Blue
      Zone designation, given to countries with long-living populations.

      You can feel good about making this for your friends and family, knowing
      that it is, not only delicious, but also nutricious!
