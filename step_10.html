  <h1 id="main-title">costa rican gallo pinto</h1>
  <p>
    <i><b>Gallo Pinto</b></i> is a traditional Cental American dish and has a
    long history in both Nicaraguan and Costa Rican culture. In Costa Rica,
    this breakfast dish is usually served with a fried egg, fresh plantains,
    <i>homemade</i> tortillas, and a cup of Costa Rican coffee.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rice and black beans are staples in the Costa Rican diet, and Gallo Pinto
    is typically made using the rice and beans that are leftover from the day
    before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gallo Pinto translates to <q>spotted rooster</q>. The name is said to come
    from the speckeled appearance of the dish.
  </p>
  <p>
    Would you beleive me if I told you that Gallo Pinto is considered one of
    the healthiest breakfast meals in the world? It's true! Accoring to Mike
    Dunphy's list of <cite><a href="https://time.com/4254125/healthy-international-breakfast/" target="_blank">10
        Healthy International Breakfasts</a></cite>:
  <blockquote>
    Black beans—and the heavy amounts of iron, zinc, potassium, thiamin, and folate
    inside—play a central role in breakfast here. Mixed with rice, spiced with
    cumin, pepper, and garlic, Gallo Pinto often comes with eggs on the side
    and a host of vitamin-rich tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, papaya,
    and plantains. The breakfast might have a lot to do with Costa Rica's Blue
    Zone designation, given to countries with long-living populations.

    that it is, not only delicious, but also nutricious!
